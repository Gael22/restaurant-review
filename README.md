# Project overview
Students were asked to convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. In Stage One, the student takes a static design that lacks accessibility and converts the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. Students also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for their users.<br>

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
